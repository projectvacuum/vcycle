We are pleased to announce the release of Vcycle 01.00.00

RPMs for CentOS 7 and the Admin Guide are available from the 01.00
subdirectory of

https://repo.gridpp.ac.uk/vacproject/vcycle/

This version introduces CentOS 7 support, mulitpart Vacuum Pipes, capacity
publishing to GOCDB, as described in the man pages and Admin Guide.

If upgrading from a version before 01.00.00 (including prereleases) please
drain the projects of VMs first. 

A significant change to the configuration file format is that the number 
of VMs per space or per machinetype is limited by processors_limit if given
(it's usually better to use target shares). max_processors is now used to
give the maximum number of processors for a single VM in machinetypes rather
than being a space-wide or machinetype-wide limit. This change has been
introduced for consistency with Vacuum Pipes and Vac.

The improvements listed in CHANGES are:
